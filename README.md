# Jet-Warrior
A modern take on Asteroids with a virtual reality spin. You are able to use two hand mounted rocket engines to propel yourself through space as well as the attached grappling hooks and bombs to destroy the asteroids. The game emphasizes movement allowing you to land and walk across the surface of asteroids while you plant your bombs. It's a completely new view on a classic!

The development of Jet Warrior is public and you can watch things as they happened on my [YouTube Channel World of Zero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEwYhelKHmiis0r85JEW-WUCKVZ9Ju4z0)
